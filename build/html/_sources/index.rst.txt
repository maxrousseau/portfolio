About
-----

My name is Maxime Rousseau, I am a dentist doing a residency at the Montreal
Children's Hospital. I graduated as a DMD from McGill University in 2020. Over the
past few years I developed a passion for scientific research and
programming. My interests lie in how to leverage machine learning and other
computational methods in dentistry. I have a few publications and active
projects, they are listed below.
